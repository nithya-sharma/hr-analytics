# HR Analytics Dashboard – Attrition Analysis

This project explores employee attrition trends using data visualization and statistical analysis. It combines Python-based data processing with interactive dashboards in Looker Studio, offering HR professionals and decision-makers clear, data-driven insights into factors influencing employee retention.

> Originally developed as part of coursework in Predictive Analytics at VIT, this version builds on those foundations to deliver a more structured and business-ready analytical solution.

## 🧩 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize various dimensions of employee data—such as department, job level, training hours, and performance rating—to identify patterns and predictors of attrition. 

The foundation was laid through exploratory data analysis in Python. In its current form, the project features a polished Looker Studio dashboard and a Business Requirements Report (BRR) to support stakeholder-driven decision-making.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Departments with higher attrition often had lower average training hours or imbalanced job level distributions.  
- Marital status may influence the training-performance dynamic among those who exited the company.  
- Attrition varies significantly across departments and roles, suggesting that targeted retention strategies could be more impactful.
