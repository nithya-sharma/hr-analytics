# HR Analytics 

This project explores employee attrition trends using data visualization and statistical analysis. It combines Python-based data processing with interactive dashboards in Looker Studio, offering HR professionals and decision-makers clear, data-driven insights into factors influencing employee retention.

> Originally developed as part of coursework in Predictive Analytics at VIT, this version builds on those foundations to deliver a more structured and business-ready analytical solution.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize various dimensions of employee data‚Äîsuch as department, job level, training hours, and performance rating‚Äîto identify patterns and predictors of attrition. 

The foundation was laid through exploratory data analysis in Python. In its current form, the project features a polished Looker Studio dashboard and a Business Requirements Report (BRR) to support stakeholder-driven decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Attrition Analysis by Department & Job Role**  
  Understand attrition distribution across departments and roles with optional granularity.

- **Attrition Rate vs Employee Count**  
  Dual-metric visualization showing the relationship between department strength and attrition rates.

- **Job Level Distribution vs Attrition**  
  Compare how employee levels correlate with attrition rates.

- **Training Hours vs Performance Scatter Plot**  
  Explore how employee development efforts relate to performance, segmented by marital status and filtered for attrition cases.

- **Interactive Filters**  
  Drill down by Gender, Marital Status, Department, Education Field, Job Role, and more.

- **Business Requirements Report (BRR)**  
  Formal documentation outlining problem statements, KPIs, stakeholder needs, and dashboard objectives.

## üß† Key Insights

- Departments with higher attrition often had lower average training hours or imbalanced job level distributions.  
- Marital status may influence the training-performance dynamic among those who exited the company.  
- Attrition varies significantly across departments and roles, suggesting that targeted retention strategies could be more impactful.
